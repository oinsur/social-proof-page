## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this challenge I was able to practice working with multiple background images and place them in containers.
I also learned how to work up from a mobile through desktop layout and get some more practice on that. I also learned
how to use pseudo-classes to select individual HMTL items to apply unique CSS for the layout.

### Continued development

I would like to continue to learn about how to use pseudo-classes with CSS to add unique styles in layouts.

### Useful resources

- [:nth-of-type()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-of-type) - This resource helped me learn more about using the :nth-of-type selector. This helped to eliminate the need for additional classes.
- [:nth-of-type](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/selectors/n/nth-of-type/) - This was another resource that helped me learn more about using the nth-of-type selector.
